Meanwhile, the CEI has been flat over the past six months and its six-month growth rate has moved out of negative territory. Taken together, the recent behavior of the composite indexes suggests that the recovery in economic activity will continue in the near term. </p>\n<p>\n  About The Conference Board Leading Economic Index(R) (LEI) for France </p>\n<p>\n  The composite economic indexes are the key elements in an analytic system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. The leading and coincident economic indexes are essentially composite averages of several individual leading or coincident indicators. They are constructed to summarize and reveal common turning point patterns in economic data in a clearer and more convincing manner than any individual component -- primarily because they smooth out some of the volatility of individual components. </p>\n<p>\n  The seven components of The Conference Board Leading Economic Index(R) for France include: </p>\n<p>\n  Yield Spread, 10 year minus Day-Day Loan </p>\n<p>\n  Stock Price SBF 250 Index </p>\n<p>\n  Building Permits, residential </p>\n<p>\n  New Unemployment Claims </p>\n<p>\n  Industrial New Orders </p>\n<p>\n  Production Expectations </p>\n<p>\n  Ratio Deflator of Manufacturing Value Added to Unit Labor Cost </p>\n<p>\n  For more information including full press release and technical notes: </p>\n<p>\n  http://www.conference-board.org/data/bcicountry.cfm?cid=3 </p>\n<p>\n  For more information about The Conference Board global business cycle indicators: </p>\n<p>\n  http://www.conference-board.org/data/bci.cfm </p>\n<p>\n  About The Conference Board </p>\n<p>\n  The Conference Board is an independent business membership and research association working in the public interest.
